Changes/Errors in IglooScore1

  In overallScore() function: 
    -I changed the first "if" condition to pick the lower of the two scores instead of the highest score.

Changes/Errors in IglooScore2

  In overallScore() function:
    -In the first elseif() statement, set s2 to score3 to get to proper highest score.
    -In the else{} statement, changed the score to be set to one of the three scores since this case
     is only picked when all the scores are equivalent.
  In main() function
    -took out the case for null checking since it is not necessary.
